## Junior Back-End Developer | Java | SQL | Linux

I'm a **Junior Back-End Developer based in São Paulo, Brazil**, with a **degree in Information Technology** and a strong analytical and scientific background.

I work primarily with **Java (Object-Oriented Programming)** and **relational databases**, focusing on **system logic, data modeling, and backend fundamentals**. I also have experience using **Linux environments**, version control with **Git/GitHub**, and development workflows with **GitHub Actions**.

I studied **Physics at UNESP**, which strengthened my **mathematical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and abstraction abilities**, now applied to software development.

I'm currently focused on growing as a **back-end engineer**, learning best practices such as **Clean Code** and **Clean Architecture**, and expanding my knowledge in **C#, .NET, and cloud concepts (AWS)**.
